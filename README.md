# Code-Cryption
Set of codes that encript code secretly and decripts them back.

Have you ever wanted to encript your code so no one can read them?
Have you ever wanted to build a website with code, but you don't want anybody to be able to access its contents?

Well you're in luck!
You have come to the right place!

These codes help you to encript codes in binary and decript them too, just using two scripts:

· Encript.py: To encript  ;)
· Decript.py: To decript

Have fun coding!!!
